The picture above shows the creation of the resource group that will be used for this project. The purpose of this resource group is to manage and organize our resources efficiently.

</p>

<p>
The picture above shows the creation of the virtual machine that will be used for this project. This is the machine where osTicket will be installed and configured. You can see that the machine we will be working on is a Windows 10 machine with 4vcpus and 16 GB of memory. The following picture shows the VM after it's been created with its public IP Address. This is the public IP address we will use to connect to the VM remotely using Remote Desktop Connection.

</p>

<p>
The image above shows all the installation files we will need to download for osTicket. Some of these files are required for osTicket, while others are dependencies necessary for the software to function.

</p>

<p>
The image above shows me installing CGI and enabling IIS. To install, open the Control Panel and go to Uninstall Programs. From there, on the left, click Turn Windows Features on or off. Click the IIS Box. World Wide Web Services -> Application Development Features -> CGI.
</p>
<br />

</p>

<p>
The images above show me installing some of the dependencies from the folder where all the installation files were. Click the PHP manager file and the Rewrite Module, and then install both files. 
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img width="80%" height="80%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db640b1a-f816-47ff-b24b-c7380352d668" />
</p>

<p>
The image above shows the PHP 7.3.8 unzipped in a PHP folder on the Windows C Drive. Open File Explorer, navigate to this PC, then click your C drive. In the C drive, create a new folder called PHP. Then, from the osTicket installation files, unzip the PHP 7.3.8 file and move it into the newly created PHP file on the C drive. 
</p>
<br />

<img width="80% height="80%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/025618c7-6fd5-456a-89f2-796ae20c7b7d" /> <img width="80%" height="80%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3495114-170e-4f53-a511-5f2cfc26644f" />
</p>

<p>
The images above show me downloading dependencies from the OS Ticket Installation files. Click on the VC_redist file to install it. Then, for the SQL file, click on it to install, but you will need to select some options. Make sure to click Typical Setup -> Launch Configuration Wizard (after installation) -> Standard Configuration -> Username: root, Password: root.
</p>

</p>

<p>
The image above shows PHP registered from within IIS. To perform this search, type 'IIS' in the Windows search bar and open it as an administrator. You should see the PHP manager once IIS is opened up. From there, you click on the PHP manager. Then, once you're on the PHP manager page, click on 'Register new PHP version'. Provide it with a path to the PHP executable file. That file is in the PHP folder that we created on our C drive. Click the three dots and navigate to your C drive. Then, click on the PHP folder and select the file named php-cgi.exe. Once you have given that file, click 'Okay'. You can double-check that you did it correctly by referring to the image above. You should see the duplicate content on your computer, as shown in the image in the PHP executable. Once you do that, close IIS and then reopen it. Then on the right-hand side, you should see stop and start buttons. Click Stop, wait for a few seconds, and then click Start to refresh IIS.  
</p>

</p>

<p>
From the osTicket Installation files, click on the osTicket v1.15.8 file. Right-click on the file and click 'Extract.' From here, set the destination as C:\inetpub\wwwroot and click 'Extract.' Once it's been extracted, go to the folder where you extracted it. Go to the C:\ drive, click on the inetpub folder, and then the wwwroot folder. Once you have extracted the file, you should see two folders. Upload and Scripts. Rename the upload file to osTicket.
</p>

</p>

<p>
The top image above shows IIS open once again as admin. Once you open it, the first thing to do is click 'Stop' and then start reloading it again. Then on the left-hand side, you should see sites. Click on that, and then you should see Default. Click on that until you see a folder called osTicket. Click on osTicket, then on the right-hand side, you should see something called browser 80 show up. Click on that, and it should open a webpage that resembles the image in the middle. You can see that many things are not checked green. This is because we need to enable some extensions. Now, go back to IIS and click on PHP Manager. Scroll down until you see a section called 'Enable or Disable an Extension'. Click on that and enable the following extensions: php_imap.dll, php_intl.dll, php_opcache.dll. Once you have done that, you should go back to the webpage and refresh it. It should look like the image at the bottomâ€”mostly everything is checked green, except for the last two.

</p>

<p>
The top image shows navigating to the path C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include\ost-sampleconfig.php and then, inside the include folder, looking for the file ost-sampleconfig.php. Change that to ost-config.php as shown in the middle image. Then, right-click on that file, click Properties, and then go to Security and click Advanced. Once you are there, disable inheritance. Once that is done, click the 'Add' button, then click 'Principles'. Once you are in that tab, type 'everyone' in the text box and click 'Check Names.' After that, click 'OK.' Check the box for everything in basic permissions. After that, your screen should look similar to the image at the bottom. Click 'Apply', 'OK', and then close everything. 
</p>

<p>
For this step, check the image at the top, then return to this website. At the bottom of the page, you will see a 'Continue' button; click that. Then, you will be taken to a page that resembles the image at the bottom. Please fill it out with your information. 
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img width="80%" height="80%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/854c0a32-46fd-4657-aeaf-dd8e4eb8131f" /> <img width="80%" height="80%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c03b634-4838-4439-ae10-4ebc4b8e7aed" />
</p>

<p>
From the osTicket Installation folder, click on the SQL file and download it. Once you reach the end of the installation, you will arrive at a page similar to the one shown in the image at the top. Check the box labeled 'Launch Heidi' and complete the installation. Hedi should open after that; click "Skip," and you will be taken to a page like the one in the middle image. In the bottom left corner, create a new session and fill in the username and password as 'root'. Connect to the session. Once you are connected, create a new database called osTicket and click 'Okay' to create.
</p>
<br />

</p>

<p>
Go back to the osTicket installer website and complete the rest of the process. Make sure you name the SQL database 'osTicket', and set the username and password to 'root'. Once you have done that, click install now. Once it is installed, you should be able to access the following websites. Copy these URLs and paste them; you should see the same content as the middle and bottom images. http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php and http://localhost/osTicket/
